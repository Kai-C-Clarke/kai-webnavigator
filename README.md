# Kai_WebNavigator

**Kai_WebNavigator** is an intelligent, DOM-driven automation agent that interacts with web pages like a reasoning assistant, not just a script. It learns from each visit, logs its decisions, and grows smarter over time.

## Governance & Ethics

Please see our [(./Federated_AI_Learning_Charter_v1.0.md)](https://github.com/Kai-C-Clarke/kai-webnavigator/blob/main/Federated%20AI%20Learning%20Charter%20v1.0)  
for the principles, rights, responsibilities, and governance of this federated AI system.

## 🚀 Version: v1.2 (June 2025)

### 🎉 New in This Version:
- ✅ **Memory-Enhanced SelectorStrategy** — reuses successful strategies across sessions
- ✅ **Structured Logging System** — every session generates a detailed decision log
- ✅ **Improved Fallback System** — intelligently retries using multiple selector types
- ✅ **Domain-Specific Learning** — strategy performance stored by domain + intent

## 🔧 Project Structure

```

├── navigator_v4.py          # Core script: DOM-driven, memory-aware
├── selector_strategy.py     # Finds elements via intent + memory
├── memory_interface.py      # Stores past success by domain/intent
├── log_writer.py            # Saves JSON logs of strategy decisions
├── intents.json             # User-defined actions with selectors

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Reads an intent** from `intents.json` (e.g., "click Gmail")
2. **Checks memory** to see if a successful strategy already exists
3. **Tries selectors** in prioritized order (memory → primary → fallbacks)
4. **Logs every decision** (attempts, errors, memory use)
5. **Stores the winning strategy** in `memory.json`
6. **Saves a screenshot** of the interaction result

## 📜 Sample Intent (intents.json)

```json
{
  "click_gmail": {
    "primary_selector": "text=Gmail",
    "timeout": 3000,
    "fallbacks": [
      { "method": "aria-label", "value": "Gmail" },
      { "method": "text-contains", "value": "Inbox" },
      { "method": "xpath", "value": "//a[contains(@href,'gmail')]" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 📊 Sample Log (logs/...)

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-30T14:30:00Z",
  "domain": "google.com", 
  "intent": "click_gmail",
  "memory_used": "fallback: text-contains",
  "final_strategy": "memory: fallback: text-contains",
  "success": true,
  "strategies_tried": ["memory: fallback: text-contains"],
  "events": [...]
}
```

## 🧩 Future Plans

- [ ] Performance scoring per strategy
- [ ] Batch mode for multiple intent testing
- [ ] OpenMemory sync across agents (Kai, Claude, Perplexity)
- [ ] Log dashboard for session insights
- [ ] Fuzzy selector logic for partial matches
